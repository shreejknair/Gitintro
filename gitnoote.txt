1. What is Git?
Git is a tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.The features of Git :
a.Tracks history.
b.Free and open source.
c.Supports non-linear development.
d.Creates backups.
e.Scalable.
f.Supports collaboration.

-Fast forward merges and squashed merges.
-Integration and analytics on API and management of everyday activities.
-Provides greater control over data security, customization.

Bitbucket:
BitBucket is a cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control the changes to their code. 
-Not an open source.
-Pull requests with code review and comments.
-Bitbucket Pipelines, a continuous delivery service.

4.Industrial practices of Git:
-Obtain feedback through code reviews.
-Write descriptive commit messages.
-Make incremental,small changes.
